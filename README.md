DEMOGRAPHICS
Our term Project will concentrate on Demographics which is an important field of study 

with important implications for planning and resource management.  Changing lifestyle patterns 

and human migration can change the infrastructure needs of communities, but infrastructure 

projects by their nature require large investments in both time and capital.  Our project will apply 

data mining techniques to intelligent planning of mass transit infrastructure. 

The US Census is an important source of demographic data, and we will focus on the 

American Community Survey, collected by the Census Bureau.  The American Community 

Survey provides detailed information on lifestyle and career data, including commuting times, 

mass transit usage, population density, household and personal income, and housing type.  By 

looking at data from the American Community Survey over time, we will be able to examine 

change in the data as well as relationships between the data types. 

We predict that there will be a strong positive correlation between population density and 

mass transit usage.  We also predict that there will be a strong positive correlation between 

income and population density.  In other words, income and mass transit usage will both be 

higher in heavily populated areas.  The more interesting questions are not as easy to answer 

without performing data mining analysis however.  Is there a definable population density 

threshold which sees a large increase in commuting times and mass transit usage?  Does the data 

not conform well to predictable patterns based on human planning and decision making?  Can 

we predict where mass transit infrastructure will be most and least needed based on demographic 

trends?  What is the relationship between commuting times and mass transit usage?  Does mass 

transit decrease commuting times (it is clear that it has a positive ecological impact)?
